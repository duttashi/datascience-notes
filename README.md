## Data Science Notes

As a sophomore, I would often create some `last minute notes`. The motivation to build this project, stems from this `need`. Nowadays's, often there arises an urgent requirement to reference notes, if conducting/preparing for a `(data-science)` interview or a presentation. Thus, in this project, I'm building solutions that are quickly referable in such situations.
