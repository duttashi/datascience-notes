Objective: A curated list of handy `base R` functions for data preprocessing tasks. This list can be used for interview questions and answers.

```{r}
data("airquality")

# check data dimensions
dim(airquality)

# check missing values
colSums(is.na(airquality))
```
Let's look at the data structure
```{r}
str(airquality)
```

The variables `Ozone` and `Solar.R` contain missing values. Both of them are continuous in nature. So to impute the missing data, we can use the `median`.
```{r}
for(i in 1:ncol(airquality)){
  airquality[is.na(airquality[,i]), i] <- median(airquality[,i], na.rm = TRUE)
}
```
Check for missing values again.
```{r}
colSums(is.na(airquality))
```
