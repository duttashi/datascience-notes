#### OBJECTIVE

The repository serves as a step-by-step guide for people who want to get started in machine learning and predictive modelling. The project is still in it's initial stages and any contributions are highly appreciated. It currently contains code snippets I have written while participating in a few kaggle and other competitions.

##### COMPETITIONS

- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

This is one of the best place to get your hands dirty. In this kaggle challenge, we are asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we are asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
