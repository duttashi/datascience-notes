The metrics that you choose to evaluate your machine learning algorithms are very important.

Choice of metrics influences how the performance of machine learning algorithms is measured and compared. They influence how you weight the importance of different characteristics in the results and your ultimate choice of which algorithm to choose.

In this repository, you will see how to select and use different machine learning performance metrics in `Python` with `scikit-learn` and in `R` with helper packages.

Metrics are demonstrated for classification, clustering and regression type machine learning problems.

- For `classification metrics`, the `Pima Indians` onset of [diabetes dataset]() is used as demonstration. This is a binary classification problem where all of the input variables are numeric (update: download from here).
- For `regression metrics`, the `Boston House Price` [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/) is used as demonstration. this is a regression problem where all of the input variables are also numeric.
- For clustering, the `Water Treatment Plant` [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/water+treatment+plant) from UCI ML repo is used.
